// what is a Morse code?
is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different  signal durations, called dits and dashes, or dits and days.

// why is Morse code was created?
Morse code ,either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots,dashes, and spaces.  The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights. one of the systems was invented in the United States by  American airtist and inventor Samuel F.B Morse during the 1830s for electrical telegraphs.

This version was further improved by American scientist and businessman Alfred Lewis  Vail, Morse's assistant and partner.Soon after it's introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it lacked codes for letters with diacritic marks. To remedy this deficiency,  a variant called the international Morse Code was devised by a conference of European nations in 1851.
The two systems are similar, but the international morse code is simpler and more precise, for example the original Morse code used patterns of dots and spaces to represent a few of the letters, whereas the International Morse uses combitinations of dots and short dashes rather than the variable lengths used in the original Morse Code.
The international Morse code has, except for some minor changes in 1938, remained the same since its inception .The American telegraph industry never abandoned the original Morse code, and so it's use continued until the spread of teleprinters in the 1920s and 30s. international Morse code was used in world War ll and in the Korean and Vietnam wars it was used heavily by the Shipping industry and for the safety of the seas up until the early 1990s.
